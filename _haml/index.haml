              Transactions confirmation times on Dogeparty are typically 10x faster than traditional Bitcoin
              transactions, at 1-10 minutes. This opens the door to whole new applications impossible with slower network speeds.

              A lot, actually. Making your own token on Dogeparty means you can have your own asset to distribute, while
              still supporting the Dogecoin network and community. Raise funds in DOGE, and reward your supporters with
              a custom coin that can be tailored to your needs, without needing your own blockchain!

              Planning an actual Doge Party, or even just a normal human event? Raise funds for the work and costs
              by selling an EVENT coin that can then be used at the event to pay for entry, drinks, and shibe snacks.
              You get the funds up front, and your guests get something tangible (and fungible) in return. This allows
              you to cover costs, and also give your backers a guaranteed unit of value beyond a name on the guestlist.
              In fact, the coin IS the guestlist!

              are auctioned for the CharityCoin at one-off or periodic events where only the CharityCoin is accepted.

                Dogeparty uses XDP, a coin that can be controlled by the Dogeparty protocol. This means that XDP can do some
                things that are impossible for a standard Dogecoin. Most importantly the Dogeparty protocol itself can be the
                trusted third party in a variety of ways.
              %p
                For example, when someone places an order to sell XDP, or places a bet, or buys a Dogeparty-created asset
                using XDP, the funds for their order are held by the Dogecoin blockchain, enabling easy, fast, and trustless
                interactions. So, while Dogeparty runs on the power of DOGE, you'll need XDP to do awesome things on Dogeparty.
              %p
                We have created ***** XDP for allocation, which will be distributed via Proof of Charity (PoC). For more
                information on that and other issuance details, please download the doc below.
