      <h1>Why Dogeparty?</h1>
      <p>
        Bitcoin-based Counterparty is a fantastic system for serious crypto-finance, but for smaller
        value transactions, when it comes to placing orders, creating assets, and generally taking care
        of business Doge brings some great advantages to the party.

          <h2>10x Faster</h2>
          <p>
            Transactions confirmation times on Dogeparty are typically 10x faster than traditional Bitcoin
            transactions, at 1-10 minutes. This opens the door to whole new applications impossible with slower network speeds.

          <h2>100x Cheaper</h2>
          <p>
            Bitcoin transaction fees can be around .... while doge fees are closer to ... This means that micro-transactions
            that would be unfeasible on Bitcoin can thrive on Dogeparty, ideal for socially oriented projects.

      <h1>Get Started</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Get some dogecoin (DOGE): You'll need this to get yourself some XDP, the Dogeparty coin needed to create assets
          and do other cool stuff. Luckily, DOGE are easy to get! Make a smart comment over on reddit.com/r/dogecoin
          to get tips from users, try an exchange like Cryptsy, or check out Dogecoin Faucets.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will also need to grab yourself a Counterwallet, in order to create and hold the Dogeparty token assets.
          You can create one at counterwallet.co
        </li>
        <li>
          Hang on until the Dogeparty launch time, when the address to send your Doge is revealed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Can I Do with Dogeparty?</h2>
      <p>
        A lot, actually. Making your own token on Dogeparty means you can have your own asset to distribute, while
        still supporting the Dogecoin network and community. Raise funds in DOGE, and reward your supporters with
        a custom coin that can be tailored to your needs, without needing your own blockchain!

          <h3>Create</h3>
          <p>
            Want to publish a book or album without a publisher or have an amazing product ? Create your own token,
            put up a page explaining your goals and collect DOGE donations from your supporters!  You get the funds,
            your backers get a token that can give them access or  a share of the project. When you're ready,
            reward your backers by trading your work for the coin you gave out.

          <h3>Plan events</h3>
          <p>
            Planning an actual Doge Party, or even just a normal human event? Raise funds for the work and costs
            by selling an EVENT coin that can then be used at the event to pay for entry, drinks, and shibe snacks.
            You get the funds up front, and your guests get something tangible (and fungible) in return. This allows
            you to cover costs, and also give your backers a guaranteed unit of value beyond a name on the guestlist.
            In fact, the coin IS the guestlist!

          <h3>Give back</h3>
          <p>
            Raising funds for doing good?  Create a CharityCoin to give back to donors who support your cause.
            You can then make the token valuable by having businesses and supporters donate   and services which
            are auctioned for the CharityCoin at one-off or periodic events where only the CharityCoin is accepted.

      <h1>What is XDP?</h1>
      <p>
        Dogeparty uses XDP, a coin that can be controlled by the Dogeparty protocol. This means that XDP can do some
        things that are impossible for a standard Dogecoin. Most importantly the Dogeparty protocol itself can be the
        trusted third party in a variety of ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, when someone places an order to sell XDP, or places a bet, or buys a Dogeparty-created asset
        using XDP, the funds for their order are held by the Dogecoin blockchain, enabling easy, fast, and trustless
        interactions. So, while Dogeparty runs on the power of DOGE, you'll need XDP to do awesome things on Dogeparty.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have created ***** XDP for allocation, which will be distributed via Proof of Charity (PoC). For more
        information on that and other issuance details, please download the doc below.
